          <h4>Full-Stack Developer | Front-End Specialist</h4>
          <p>
            Innovative and experienced software professional with a proven track
            record of success in full-stack development and a specialization in
            front-end technologies. With a solid foundation in Java full-stack
            development, I transitioned into consulting and application support
            for several years before returning to my passion for product
            development. I am currently thriving as a Full Stack Developer,
            leveraging my strong skill set in front-end development with
            JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, along with expertise in backend
            API development using Ruby on Rails. With over 11 years of
            comprehensive industry experience, I bring a unique blend of
            technical proficiency, strategic thinking, and client-oriented
            approach to drive impactful solutions.
